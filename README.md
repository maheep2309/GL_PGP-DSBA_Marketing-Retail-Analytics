# GL_PGP-DSBA_Marketing-Retail-Analytics
This project analyzes automobile sales using RFM segmentation and explores grocery retail transactions using market basket analysis. It identifies customer segments, buying patterns, and strong product associations to guide targeted marketing, improve retention, optimize promotions, and increase revenue.

# Project Summary
This project covers two major business problems: Automobile Sales Analytics and Grocery Retail Analytics, each aimed at improving customer understanding and driving revenue.

Part A: Automobile Sales (RFM Segmentation)

An automobile parts manufacturer’s 3-year transaction data is analyzed to uncover customer behavior, sales trends, and regional performance patterns. Exploratory analysis reveals that Classic and Vintage car parts dominate sales, the US is the strongest market, Madrid and NYC are high-revenue cities, and November drives peak seasonal sales. Losses from disputed/cancelled orders are concentrated in specific cities, prompting operational improvement opportunities.

Using RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) combined with K-Means clustering, customers are segmented into Best, Loyal, Verge-of-Churning, and Lost categories. Each segment is profiled with targeted strategies — VIP programs for Best customers, loyalty optimization for Loyal customers, reactivation campaigns for at-risk customers, and low-cost outreach for Lost customers. The insights guide personalized marketing, retention strategies, and region-specific growth efforts. 

Part B: Grocery Retail (Market Basket Analysis)

Point-of-sale data from a grocery store is examined to understand product demand and co-purchase behavior. Poultry, soda, and cereals emerge as top-selling items, with Sunday and Friday showing the highest purchase volumes. Quarterly trends indicate sales decline beginning in late 2019.

Using Market Basket Analysis (MBA) through KNIME, strong item associations are identified (e.g., Poultry → Juice, Eggs + Paper Towels → Ice Cream, Pasta → Eggs). Lift values above 1.6 highlight powerful cross-sell opportunities. The results support store layout optimization, combo deals, personalized offers, and inventory alignment with frequently purchased itemsets. 

Overall Impact

The project equips businesses with actionable strategies:

Personalized campaigns and loyalty programs for high-value customer segments.

Revenue recovery through churn-reduction actions.

Optimized product placement, targeted bundles, and cross-selling in grocery retail.

Data-driven decisions for improved sales, customer engagement, and operational efficiency.
